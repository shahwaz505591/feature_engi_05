    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding: It is a type of categorical encoding where each category is assigned a unique integer based on its order or rank. For example, in the case of size (small, medium, large), you might assign 1 to small, 2 to medium, and 3 to large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding: It is a more general categorical encoding method where each category is assigned a unique integer, without considering any order or rank. For example, in the case of color (red, green, blue), you might assign 1 to red, 2 to green, and 3 to blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to choose one over the other:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Ordinal Encoding when there is a clear order or rank among the categories, and this order is essential for the model (e.g., low, medium, high).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Label Encoding when there is no inherent order among the categories, and they are just distinct labels without any meaningful rank."
